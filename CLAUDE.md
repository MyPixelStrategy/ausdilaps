# AusDilaps — Project Brief & Big-Build Plan

**Read this first. It is the full context for the AusDilaps website. Paste it into a fresh session or rely on it auto-loading. Build from the REAL content referenced here — never invent stats, claims, or projects.**

---

## 1. What this is

A ground-up rebuild of **ausdilaps.com.au** for **AusDilaps — Specialist Building Inspections**, Australia's specialist **dilapidation (building condition) report** firm. ~$5M revenue, family-owned, 15 years, team <50. Legal entity **Urban Pulse Strategies Pty Ltd T/A AusDilaps**, ABN **82 650 700 226**, Albany Creek / Aspley QLD, Australia-wide.

It replaces an old WordPress/Tatsu site (kept locally as a read-only reference at `20260616-AusDilaps-WordPress/` — git/vercel-ignored). The live old site still ranks for hundreds of terms; **we must preserve that** (see §7).

**This repo is one thing: a marketing + lead-generation + content platform.** There are **NO client logins** here. A future client portal will be a **separate system** — do not build it here.

---

## 2. The vision — the best this can be

Not a brochure. The goal is to make AusDilaps **the category authority** in Australian dilapidation reporting:

1. **SEO + AEO + GEO dominance.** Own the informational long tail, win the AI overviews / featured snippets / People-also-ask / local packs already showing on these terms, and become the **source LLMs cite** (GEO: structured data everywhere, answer-first copy, E-E-A-T, `llms.txt`).
2. **Expansive & deep.** Every service, sector, location, and the full 22-project portfolio — each a real, schema-rich page. Not consolidated away; the long tail is the moat.
3. **A content & news engine** that makes AusDilaps the voice of the industry — natural events (earthquakes, storms, cyclones, floods), major projects (Brisbane 2032, Sydney/Melbourne tunnels), dilapidation knowledge, and **advocacy** (lobbying state governments to adopt compulsory dilapidation reporting — the NSW model). This is the thought-leadership + lobbying platform.
4. **A conversion machine.** Every page routes to a qualified quote. The form captures real project detail, classifies the lead (Tier-1 vs residential), and pushes to Salesforce.
5. **Craft an engineer is proud of.** Fast, accessible, precise, beautiful. Hybrid light/charcoal design from the logo.

**Positioning line to build around:** *AusDilaps is the Tier 1 dilapidation specialist Australian contractors and government agencies trust when a damage claim has to be defensible, not just delivered.* (StoryBrand: the customer — a project manager / contracts admin / council risk officer — is the hero; we are the guide with Tier-1 proof + chartered engineers.)

## 3. Current state (already built & LIVE — don't redo)

- **Repo:** `github.com/MyPixelStrategy/ausdilaps`. **Deployed:** `ausdilaps.vercel.app` (Vercel, connected via git — **every push to `main` auto-deploys**).
- **Pages live:** `/` (homepage on real content), `/faq` (full, FAQPage schema), `/dilapidation-reports` (pillar, Service + HowTo + FAQPage schema), `/styleguide`.
- **Design system + brand** implemented (see §5). Real logo wired into header/footer.
- **Real data captured:** `lib/site.ts`, `data/faq.ts`, `data/case-studies.ts`, `seo/legacy-seo-map.md`, `seo/content-backlog.md`.
- **Supabase project** exists: ref `zjgntkfzgtrqkklglhpo` (Tokyo region — Sydney wasn't available). Schema written at `supabase/migrations/0001_init.sql` — **not yet run** (see §10).
- **Build is green.** Always keep it that way: `npm run build`.

---

## 4. Stack & conventions

- **Next.js 16.2.4 (App Router, Turbopack) · React 19 · TypeScript · Tailwind v4 · shadcn/ui (style `base-nova`, neutral)**. Mirrors the sibling project `Sigma Sync/web`.
- **Flat root, no `src/`.** Path alias `@/*` → repo root.
- Route group `app/(marketing)/` wraps public pages with `SiteHeader` + `SiteFooter`.
- **Supabase:** `@supabase/ssr` — `lib/supabase/{server,client,admin}.ts` (three-client pattern). Service-role (`admin.ts`) is server-only.
- **Email:** Resend. **CRM:** Salesforce (behind `SF_SYNC_ENABLED`). **No R2, no Stripe** in v1.
- **Content data** in `data/*.ts` (structured) and (future) `content/insights/*.mdx` (editorial).
- **SEO:** `lib/seo.ts` (schema builders) + `components/seo/json-ld.tsx` (`<JsonLd>` injector). Site-wide Organization + LocalBusiness in `app/layout.tsx`.
- Run: `npm run dev` (localhost:3000) · `npm run build` · `npm run lint`.

---

## 5. Brand & design system

**Anchor = the logo** (`public/logo/ad-logo.png`, white version `ad-logo-white.png`). Steel-blue towers + "DILAPS"; charcoal "AUS" + "Specialist Building Inspections" tagline.

**Tri-colour palette** (tokens in `app/globals.css`):
- **Steel blue `#46688a`** — the brand (eyebrows, rules, links, accents). Tokens: `ad-steel` / `ad-accent` / `ad-blue`, light `ad-steel-light #6d90b4`.
- **Charcoal** — structural dark. `ad-ink #2f343a` (text), `ad-navy #2e3338` (dark bands), `ad-navy-deep #23272b` (footer/deep).
- **Orange `#e8642a`** (`ad-orange`) — **conversion accent only** (CTA buttons). Energy, used sparingly. Do NOT make it the theme.
- Base: white + `ad-surface #f3f4f5`; `ad-muted #5b6570`; borders `ad-border`.
- Fonts: **Space Grotesk** (headings, `--font-heading`), **Inter** (body). Low radius; `.rule-accent` (steel gradient) + `.rule-hairline` motifs; `.blueprint-grid` on dark bands.
- **Approach = hybrid:** light editorial base, **charcoal bands** for hero-proof/CTA/footer, large rounded photography, steel accents, orange CTAs. Reference aesthetic was the **Construktion X** template (clean, photo-led) — see `design-refs/` (gitignored).

**Components:** `components/ui/button.tsx` (cva variants: `primary` charcoal, `accent` orange, `outline`, `dark`, `onDark`, `onDarkAccent` orange, `onDarkOutline`), `components/marketing/{container,eyebrow,site-header,site-footer}.tsx`, `components/seo/json-ld.tsx`. **Reuse these; keep it consistent.**

**Known design TODOs:** header has **no mobile menu** yet (desktop nav only) — add one. Consider a header logo lockup without the tagline for small sizes.

---

## 6. Scope

**v1 (this repo):** marketing site (expansive, SEO/AEO/GEO) + **lead engine** (form → Supabase → Salesforce + email) + **admin backend** (staff-only: manage leads + author news).
- **NO client logins, no report downloads, no payments** here. The portal-era Supabase tables (`organizations/projects/reports/...`) are written-but-dormant in the migration — leave them; v1 uses only `leads` (+ `profiles`/role for staff auth).
- A future client portal = a **separate system**.

---

## 7. Real content sources (USE THESE — never fabricate)

- **`lib/site.ts`** — SITE (ABN, contact, AS 4349.0), STATS (1,000+ surveys/qtr · 1M+ photos/yr · 1,300+ hrs/mo · 600+ work orders/mo), SERVICES (Dilapidation flagship + SIA + DOA + DCA), CAPTURE_METHODS, PROCESS (the real **6-step methodology**), TEAM (Mike Burford CEO, Rhys Morgan GM, Kylie Crosson, Niro Rudrakumar, Jessica Lebbos, Martin Weng), TIER1_PROJECTS.
- **`data/faq.ts`** — the real FAQ (Dilapidation, Structural, BASIX, NatHERS), harvested verbatim from the live site.
- **`data/case-studies.ts`** — 3 real case studies with values: Main South Road Duplication **$1.1bn**, Ipswich Hospital **$710M**, Glenrowan Solar Farm **$170M** (client, location, metrics).
- **`seo/legacy-seo-map.md`** — the live ranking URLs to PRESERVE + keyword clusters (the migration map).
- **`seo/content-backlog.md`** — future content targets (Sydney/Melbourne tunnels, Brisbane 2032, natural events, advocacy).
- **The live site `ausdilaps.com.au`** — harvest more page copy with WebFetch (verbatim) as you build each service/location/project page.
- **The FY25/26 Capability Statement** (`~/Downloads/AusDilaps Capability Statement FY25-26.pdf`) — stats, team, methodology, services (SIA/DOA/DCA/DCA), case studies, "Acknowledgement of Country", "Supporting Women in the Workplace", green mission. Re-read for any service/about/methodology content.
- **WP backup** `20260616-AusDilaps-WordPress/wp-content/uploads/` — real project & service imagery (read-only; copy/downscale into `public/`).

**Services taxonomy (lead with dilapidation):** Dilapidation Reports (Commercial / Residential / Industrial) · Structural Integrity Assessments (SIA) · Defect Origin Assessments (DOA) · Defect Comparison Assessments (DCA) · Structural Engineering · Aerial Drone Surveys · Noise & Vibration Monitoring · Highways & Roads · BASIX · NatHERS. Capture methods (frame under dilapidation): photography, roadway video, drone, LiDAR, point cloud / 3D model, culvert & pipe, GPS/georeferenced.

**22 portfolio projects** (preserve `/portfolio/<slug>`): Queens Wharf, NorthConnex, Brisbane Airport, North West Rail Link, Barangaroo South, Mona Vale Road Upgrade, Port Botany Bulk Liquids Berth, The Northern Road Upgrade, WestConnex, Blacktown / Northern Beaches / Canberra hospitals, HMAS facilities, Australian War Memorial, Zig Zag Railway, Epping–Thornleigh, B-Line, TfNSW Station Refresh, Adina/Four Seasons/Circular Quay hotels, Dapto Bridge + more (see WP backup).

## 8. The big build plan

Build in this order. Each page: real content, full JSON-LD, a CTA to the quote form, mobile-friendly, build green, push (auto-deploys).

**Phase 1 — Service depth** (preserve live URLs `/our-services/<slug>` per `seo/legacy-seo-map.md`; lead with dilapidation):
`/our-services/commercial-dilapidation-reports`, `/our-services/residential-dilapidation-reports`, industrial, `/our-services/structural-engineering`, `/our-services/aerial-drone-surveys`, `/our-services/noise-and-vibration-monitoring-services`, `/our-services/defect-origin-assessments-doa`, `/our-services/highways-roads`, + SIA / DCA. Each: Service schema, inline FAQ (FAQPage), CTA. Wire the homepage service cards to these.

**Phase 2 — Pillar + locations + samples:** the `/dilapidation-reports` pillar exists; add `/dilapidation-reports/<sydney|brisbane|melbourne|perth|wollongong|canberra>` (per-location LocalBusiness schema, local copy) + `/dilapidation-reports/samples` (sample reports — ranks well).

**Phase 3 — Projects:** `/portfolio` filterable index + `/portfolio/[slug]` for all 22 (preserve slugs) + the 3 capability case studies. Project/CreativeWork schema. Copy imagery from the WP backup.

**Phase 4 — News / Insights engine** (a PRIMARY pillar): `/insights` (or `/news`) index + categories — **Natural events** (earthquakes/storms/cyclones/floods), **Major projects** (Brisbane 2032, Sydney/Melbourne tunnels), **Dilapidation knowledge** (what-is/cost/samples), **Standards & advocacy** (compulsory reporting / NSW model / AS 4349.0). MDX-first (`content/insights/*.mdx`, `gray-matter`), Article/NewsArticle schema, author + E-E-A-T. **Run a grounded research pass (verify facts/dates) before publishing tunnel/Brisbane-2032 content.** Migrate the BASIX post.

**Phase 5 — Lead engine:** rich quote form (Name, Role, Company, Email, Phone, Project name, Location, # adjoining properties, Required start date, DA condition / contract clause, Notes) → `/api/quote`: zod validate → honeypot (+ Turnstile env-gated, optional) → classify tier (role/company/#properties) → **Supabase insert (source of truth)** → Resend (admin notice to `info@ausdilaps.com.au` + enquirer ack) → **Salesforce upsert** (behind `SF_SYNC_ENABLED`). Failure-isolate each destination. Mirror `Sigma Sync/web/src/app/api/contact/route.ts`. Plus a capability-statement gated email-capture.

**Phase 6 — Admin backend (v1):** Supabase auth (staff only, `profiles.role`), `proxy.ts` guard (mirror `The Skin Collective/proxy.ts`). `/admin`: leads table (statuses new→contacted→quoted→won/lost, export) + **news authoring UI** so the team publishes insights without a developer.

**Phase 7 — SEO/AEO/GEO finalisation:** `data/redirects.ts` → `next.config.ts redirects()` — **preserve live slugs; 301 only the dated blog post + PDF samples**. `app/sitemap.ts`, `app/robots.ts`, **`public/llms.txt`** (GEO), GA4 `G-81JV6BQ2R5`, validate every schema (Rich Results), Lighthouse > 90. Domain cutover (point `ausdilaps.com.au` at Vercel) ONLY after redirects are verified — the live site stays untouched until then.

**Cross-cutting:** mobile nav, accessibility, image optimisation, breadcrumbs everywhere.

## 9. Guardrails

- **Real content only.** Pull from §7 / live site / capability statement. Never fabricate stats, clients, or claims (this is a $5M firm with government clients).
- **Preserve ranking URLs** (`seo/legacy-seo-map.md`). Don't rename traffic-earning pages.
- **Schema on every page** (Service / FAQPage / HowTo / Article / LocalBusiness / Breadcrumb / Project).
- **One design system.** Steel-blue brand + charcoal + orange CTAs. Don't reintroduce navy or sky-blue. Reuse the components.
- **Keep the build green**, then **push to `main`** — it auto-deploys to Vercel. Commit messages end with the Co-Authored-By trailer.
- **v1 only:** no client logins, no R2, no Stripe.

---

## 10. Setup the founder still needs to do

- **Run the migration:** paste `supabase/migrations/0001_init.sql` into Supabase → SQL Editor → Run (builds `leads` + the dormant portal tables).
- **Env vars** (`.env.local` locally + Vercel → Settings → Environment Variables) — see `.env.local.example`: `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`, `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`, `RESEND_API_KEY`, `RESEND_FROM_EMAIL`, `ADMIN_EMAIL=info@ausdilaps.com.au`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=https://ausdilaps.com.au`, `SF_*` (Salesforce, when ready), `NEXT_PUBLIC_GA4_ID=G-81JV6BQ2R5`. The marketing site renders without any of these; the form/admin need them.

---

## 11. Who you're working with

**Hemi Hara** (Pixel Matrix Group; AusDilaps sits under Urban Pulse). Works fast and iteratively, reviews on the live Vercel preview. Wants: **direct, no jargon, real data, ship and show.** Diagnosis before prescription; challenge assumptions; no filler. The whole point is the **expansive, authority-building content + forms** — that's the key work; the future portal is a separate system.
